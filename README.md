## Project Overview

The Large Logic Model tackles NP-type logic problems by mapping any Boolean formula (CNF/DNF, including program if–else conditions) into a continuous probabilistic space and replacing exponential SAT search with transformer-based attention over Boolean embeddings. This yields O(n log n) inference that scales to 10k+ variables while producing calibrated truth probabilities. It directly addresses the long-standing weakness of standard neural networks on symbolic reasoning, achieving high-accuracy logical inference (e.g., 96% F1) by learning clause–variable dependencies. The model outputs per-variable truth probabilities which can be thresholded and verified via symbolic checking.

## Task Definition

**Input**: Propositional formula in CNF/DNF format with n Boolean variables  
**Output**: Per-variable probabilities p(x_i = True) ∈ [0,1]  
**Evaluation**: Threshold at 0.5 to obtain assignments, verify satisfaction exactly

## Theoretical Foundation

### Computational Complexity Transformation

| Approach | Traditional SAT Solving | Neural Logic Approximation |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Values** | Binary: True (1) or False (0) | Probabilistic: [0, 1] continuous |
| **Complexity** | O(2^n) exponential | O(n log n) empirical* |
| **Scalability** | 20-30 variables | 10,000+ variables |
| **Resolution** | Deterministic | Probabilistic |

*Empirical scaling on synthetic datasets; theoretical worst-case remains superlinear for standard self-attention

## Technical Architecture

### Process Flow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert Boolean inputs (0/1) to continuous embeddings (0→0.1, 1→0.9)
2. **Embedding Layer**: 8-dimensional dense vectors, 64-bit float precision
3. **Transformer Encoder**: 6 layers, 8 attention heads for inter-variable dependencies
4. **Probabilistic Output**: Sigmoid activation mapping to [0,1] probability space
5. **Training**: Binary Cross-Entropy loss with FP/FN penalties, AdamW optimizer

### Key Libraries
- **PyTorch**: Neural network framework (torch.nn.Transformer)
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Metrics computation

2. The 4D model uses only 365 parameters while maintaining optimal performance
3. Training converges reliably within 50 epochs (approximately 5 minutes)
4. The 8D model shows faster initial convergence but both reach the same final performance

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
```bash
python >= 3.10
pip install torch numpy scikit-learn

```python
from src.dnf_generator_integrator import DNFGeneratorIntegrator

    'num_variables': 10000,
    'embedding_dim': 8
}

dnf_generator = DNFGeneratorIntegrator(config)

## Applications
- SAT/CNF solving at scale
- Program verification and synthesis
- Circuit design and optimization
- Constraint satisfaction problems
- AI planning and scheduling

## Limitations
- Provides approximate, not exact solutions
- Performance may degrade on adversarial formulas or highly imbalanced clause structures
- Requires propositional encoding for first-order or temporal logics

## Final Thoughts

This model offers a general solution path for logic-based inference. Any Boolean logic built from parentheses, NOT, AND, OR—including typical if–else conditions—can be converted to CNF/DNF and fed into this architecture. By replacing exponential exact search with scalable probabilistic inference, it retains full propositional expressiveness while handling very large instances. Future work will validate performance on industrial benchmarks and explore extensions to richer logics.
